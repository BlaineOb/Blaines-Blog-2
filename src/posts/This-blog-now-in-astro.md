# This Blog - Now in Astro!

It's been a few months since I made my post decrying poorly performing websites. It always bugged me to
have that article live lamenting overly complex pages while I wrote my own simple as hell blog as an SPA.
It was built with Svelte(pre-runes), which to be fair is a pretty performant option for an SPA, but it's
still overkill. I wanted to practice what I preach and build my dead simple website with a dead simple
tool.
